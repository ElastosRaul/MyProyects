# How to debug and test some example dapps based on the Elastos Carrier to understand better this technology

## Prerequisites
First, we need to install the following software in order to debug and test the example dapps of the Elastos Carrier and to understand better this technology:

- Visual studio CODE. This free software will help us to edit, test, develop and run the source code. Here is the [installation guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/setup/setup-overview).
- Git. Git allows us to download and upload source code from repositories. Here is the [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to download and install it on your computer.
- Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK. Follow the instructions of this [link](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Native.SDK) to download and install it. Also there are video tutorials where you can learn step by step to install and understand better this [SDK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS6d1baqGamKMwQPt51I82L5l1h51qrZA). 
- Elastos.NET.Carrier.Nodejs.SDK. After you install the last SDK, this [link](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.NET.Carrier.Nodejs.SDK) will help us to download, debug and test the example dapps based on the Elastos Carrier.
- Chrome developer tools. To debug and to test the source code we could do it with Visual Studio Code but it's much better to debug and test it with Chrome developer tools. So what we need is to install this software [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you already don't have it.

## Getting started

When everything is install what we need to do is to open Visual Studio CODE and create a worlplace file. This workplace file will help us to start with the Elastos repositories that we need. This is a example to follow:

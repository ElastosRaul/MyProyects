# Ela Pets

## A brief history of cyber pets and cryptokitties

I remmember that on the 90's a product game called Tamagotchi became very popular on my school and at first I didn't understand why so many people care about it. After watching how this game works I became aware about the potential it had. The idea is to be the owner of a pet, care about it such as a feeding it and so on.

After, the cryptos came and a game called cryptokitties came very popular and viral. You can buy, sell and even breed with other kitties. In this case, the crypto currency called ether from Ethereum became the center for buying, breeding and selling kitties.

If we want more information about how cryptokitties works we can go to this website where we can find most of the code there. [Here is the link](https://medium.com/loom-network/how-to-code-your-own-cryptokitties-style-game-on-ethereum-7c8ac86a4eb3)

If we analize the source code and their website we can find 3 main problems that cryptokitties has:

**1.- Cryptokitties is not decentralize.** I remmember when I was in a meetup in Barcelona of Elastos that Rong Cheng said that cryptokitties wasn't decentralize. Because first, the users need to access to the central server of cryptokitties and then the users can make the smart contract to the Ethereum network.

**2.- The CEO and founders of cryptokitties can pause cryptokitties smart contracts.** It's in the source code of the cryptokitties that this people can pause user smart contracts.

**3.- The network is slow.** Users can spend hours to receive their ether to buy and breed their cryptokitties. This is because all ethereum smart contracts goes to the ethereum network and the ethereum network has congestions and problems of scalability.


## So, what can provide Ela Pets?

Thanks to the Elastos Runtime, Elastos mainchains/sidechains/friendchains, Elastos Carrier and the Elastos SDK it could help to solve some of these problems. So here, in this Dapp called Ela Pets, it would be a good opportunity to test Elastos to solve the previous three major problems of cryptokitties mentioned. 

That are **to create a true Dapp, give the power to the users/owners of Ela Pets where no CEO or founder can pause smart contracts of their users and proof to create a fast network for the users/owners.**

So hopefully in the future we could create a smart web, secure and decentralize thanks to Elastos technology and their Dapps running on top.


## Ela Pets diagrams

In this part I'm sharing 2 diagrams to understand better Ela Pets. Because an image worth more than one thousand words.

This is the higher part of Ela Pets:
